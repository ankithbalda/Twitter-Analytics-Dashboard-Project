# 📊 Twitter Analytics Dashboard using Power BI

This project is my **B.Tech Computer Science & Engineering internship** at **NullClass EdTech Pvt. Ltd**, where I developed a **Twitter Analytics Dashboard** to transform raw social media data into **interactive visual insights** using **Power BI**, **DAX**, and **Power Query**.

The dashboard enables marketing teams, analysts, and stakeholders to:
- Track Twitter performance over time.
- Apply **time-based visibility filters**.
- Monitor KPIs like impressions, engagement rate, app opens, and more.
- Spot patterns and anomalies for decision-making.

## 📌 Project Overview

- **Internship Duration:** Mar 2025 – May 2025
- **Institution:** Aurora’s Technological and Research Institute
- **Guide:** Dr. B.T.R. Naresh Reddy
- **Company:** NullClass EdTech Pvt. Ltd, Tamil Nadu, India

The project involved:
1. **Data Collection** – Using a CSV dataset of tweets (`Tweet.xlsx`).
2. **Data Cleaning** – Removing errors, handling null values, and standardizing formats.
3. **Data Transformation** – Applying **Power Query** for time-zone conversion (UTC → IST), calculated columns, and conditional filters.
4. **Data Visualization** – Building an **interactive dashboard in Power BI**.
5. **Advanced Filtering Rules** – Implementing DAX measures to filter tweets based on:
   - Engagement rate thresholds
   - App open vs non-app open tweets
   - Work-hour posting (9 AM–5 PM weekdays)
   - Time-restricted visibility (12 PM–6 PM IST & 7 AM–11 AM IST)
   - Even-numbered impressions, odd tweet dates, min. character length
   - Excluding tweets containing the letter "D"
